== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, the plugin is compatible with any version of woocommerce.

= Is the plugin completely free? =

That's right, you don't have to pay to use this plugin, Enjoy.

= The PHP compatibility says this plugin only work with PHP version X? =

The plugin is made to be a support tool for as many users as possible, this means it needs code that is written for older sites as well.

Tools that check for PHP compatibility do not know how to separate this code from the real code, so it will give a false positive response.
